## Blackjack Project (fourth java project)

### Overview

For this project I wrote a program that can take input from the user and play a game or many games of Blackjack with the program. There are many classes within this project that work together to make the game possible.
I created a separate class with a main method that starts the program.  The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

### Topics
* Taking user input to create objects in a separate class
* Used non static methods
* Created an ArrayList
* Used Enums
* Made a working interactive game

### How to Run
Step 1. Input the name you would like to be called.

Step 2. Input what you would like to do next.

Step 3. Follow the onscreen instructions for playing blackjack.
